# [Fullstack Helsinki Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about)

## General

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with
JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS
that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on
GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use
of MongoDB for storing the application’s data.

The course is worth 5-13 credits, and the content is the same as in the Full
stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of
Helsinki in Spring 2020. There is also an associated project that is worth 1-10
credits.

Partners and affiliates of the course include Houston Inc, Terveystalo, Elisa,
K-ryhmä, Unity Technologies and Konecranes. See here for guest lectures on
course-related topics given by various experts from our partners and affiliates.

Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of
web programming and databases, and to know the basics of working with the Git
version-control system. You are also expected to have perseverance and the
ability for independent problem solving and information seeking.

Part 0 of the course material goes through the content and conduct of the course
in more detail. Make sure to read the material and instructions thoroughly.
